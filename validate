## For members of the VINT project, as a temporary measure, 
## one of the ways to run automatic validation
## is the following:
## ./validate > out ; diff out validate.out
##
## If all that prints out is a list of messages about
## "warning: using backward compatibility mode",
## then the automatic validation scripts ran correctly.

echo "*** test-all"
./test-all quiet
