<ul>

  <p>
  <li>
       <b>introduction</b>
       Here's the format:  a boldface set of keywords about what
       part of ns is relevant,
       text describing what's going on,
       then a signature and date.

  <p>
  <li>
       <b>queueing</b>
       Adding FRED, from the contributed code web page, into the
       main NS distribution.
       <em>(<a href="http://www.aciri.org/floyd/">[floyd]</a>

       <p>
  <li>
       <b>?</b>
       Adding RIO into the main NS distribution.  (The original authors 
       of RIO did many simulations in NS, so I would assume that they
       have an implementation somewhere...)

       Thu May 13 14:34:00 PDT 1999)</em>

       <p>
  <li>
       <b>full-tcp, validation</b>
       Validating ECN functionality for full-TCP (and, in the process,
       updating full-TCP to make sure that ECN functions the same in full-TCP
       as in one-way TCP).
       <em>(<a href="http://www.aciri.org/floyd/">[floyd]</a>
       Thu May 13 14:34:00 PDT 1999)</em>

       <p>
  <li>
       <b>full-tcp, validation</b>
       Replicating all of the TCP validation tests to make sure that
       they work as we would like with full-TCP also.  (There are a number
       of things that are tested in the one-way validation tests, but that
       are not verified in two-way (i.e., full-TCP) validation tests.
       <em>(<a href="http://www.aciri.org/floyd/">[floyd]</a>
       Thu May 13 14:34:00 PDT 1999)</em>

       <p>
  <li>
       <b>validation</b>
       Adding either short *.txt files, or longer documents, for each
       validation test that does not now have one, so that users can
       tell reasonably easily what is and is not tested in each validation
       test.
       <em>(<a href="http://www.aciri.org/floyd/">[floyd]</a>
       Thu May 13 14:34:00 PDT 1999)</em>

       <p>
  <li>
       <b>documentation, validation</b>
       Standardize documentation for valdation tests.
       <em>(<a href="http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/">[johnh]</a>
       Thu Jun 17 18:04:37 PDT 1999)</em>

       <p>
  <li>
       <b>validation</b>
       Expanding the validation tests for all of the various scheduling
       algorithms.
       <em>(<a href="http://www.aciri.org/floyd/">[floyd]</a>
       Thu May 13 14:34:00 PDT 1999)</em>

       <p>
  <li>
       <b>research results, validation</b>
       More simulation scripts on-line somewhere.  (Has everyone in the
       VINT project made all of the simulation scripts for all of the
       simulations that they have writted papers about publically available,
       so that readers can easily reproduce those simulations themselves?)
       <em>(<a href="http://www.aciri.org/floyd/">[floyd]</a>
       Thu May 13 14:34:00 PDT 1999)</em>

       <p>
  <li>
       <b>documentation</b>
       Better document trace file format
       (both ns output trace)
       and the 32-bit integer thing.
       (A very FAQ.)
