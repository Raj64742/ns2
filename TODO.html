<p>* Adding FRED, from the contributed code web page, into the
  main NS distribution.

<p>* Adding RIO into the main NS distribution.  (The original authors 
  of RIO did many simulations in NS, so I would assume that they
  have an implementation somewhere...)

<p>* Validating ECN functionality for full-TCP (and, in the process,
  updating full-TCP to make sure that ECN functions the same in full-TCP
as in one-way TCP).

<p>* eplicating all of the TCP validation tests to make sure that
  they work as we would like with full-TCP also.  (There are a number
  of things that are tested in the one-way validation tests, but that
  are not verified in two-way (i.e., full-TCP) validation tests.

<p>* Adding either short *.txt files, or longer documents, for each
  validation test that does not now have one, so that users can
  tell reasonably easily what is and is not tested in each validation
  test.

<p>* Expanding the validation tests for all of the various scheduling
  algorithms.

<p>* More simulation scripts on-line somewhere.  (Has everyone in the
  VINT project made all of the simulation scripts for all of the
  simulations that they have writted papers about publically available,
  so that readers can easily reproduce those simulations themselves?)
