<h3>Overview</h3>
</a>
The UCB/LNBL Network Simulator, "ns", is a simulation tool originally
developed by
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/">Steven McCanne</a>
previously with the
<a href="http://www-nrg.ee.lbl.gov/">Network Research Group</a>
at the
<a href="http://www.lbl.gov/LBL.html">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>.
He and his group have continued working XXX.
and now is part
<a href=http://netweb.usc.edu/vint/">VINT</a> Project.

ns is an extensible, easily configured
and programmed event-driven simulation engine, with support for
several flavors of TCP and router scheduling algorithms.  This work
derives from <a href="http://netlib.att.com/netlib/att/cs/home/keshav.html">
S. Keshav's</a>
<a href="http://minnie.cs.adfa.oz.au/REAL/">
REAL simulator</a>.

<p>
The ns simulation description language is an extension of
the Tool Command Language, <a href=http://www.sunlabs.com/research/tcl/>
Tcl</a>.  A simulation is defined by a Tcl program.  Using the ns command,
a network topology is defined, traffic sources and sinks are
configured, statistics are collected, and the simulation is invoked.
By building upon a general-purpose language, arbitrary actions
can be programmed into the configuration.

<a name=installation><hr></a>
<h3>Installation</h3>

To build ns from source, simply run the ./configure script in
the top-level of the distribution directory.  Then run 'make'.
You'll need to have Tcl (v7.5) installed (or built in
the directory above the ns tree).  If you use gcc for the
compiler, you should use gcc version 2.7.2 or later;  ns 
<a href="http://www-nrg.ee.lbl.gov/ns/compilers.html">
does not run correctly</a> 
with older versions of gcc and with some other compilers.  
ns is also not compatible 
with Tcl older than version 7.5.  ns should compile and run
an any unix system that Tcl runs on.  

<p>
To build ns from source to enable debugging, simply run ``./configure
--enable-debug''.

<p>
If you have to make changes in order to compile ns, please send in your
patches.  Likewise, if you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior,
please contact <a href=mailto:ns@magnet.cs.berkeley.edu>
ns@magnet.cs.berkeley.edu</a>
(this list includes only the developers
and is not distributed beyond our site).  Finally, if you implement ns
extensions that others can benefit from, please (if possible) send them
in for inclusion in a future release.

<p>
You might run the following command as a quick test to verify
that ns built correctly:

<p>
    % ./ns tcl/ex/test-suite.tcl tahoe1

<p>
You should see some debugging output on stdout, then an xgraph
window will pop-up with a sequence plot of the connection.
For this script to work properly,
the <a href=http://jean-luc.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Codes/xgraph/>
``animated'' version of xgraph</a> and awk must both be in your path.
See test-suite.tcl and example.tcl for more examples.  A note
describing the test suite is in
<a href="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/simtests.ps.Z">
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/simtests.ps.Z</a>.
If you make changes to the simulator, you might want to make sure
you haven't introduced bugs by running Matt Mathis' (mathis@psc.edu)
test-all script, which is included in the distribution.

<p>
The (still rough) man page, in this directory, is the only other
source of documentation.
