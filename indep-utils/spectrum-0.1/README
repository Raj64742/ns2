Usage=./spectrum -f data-file 

 --   The time instant specified is in seconds.

      The format of time series is as shown below.

      Example :

             Timestamp | no.packets
                       |
              0.001    |  5
              0.002    |  10

   0.001,0.002... the first column denotes the time in seconds
   5,10.....  the second column denotes the Number of packets occuring in that  time instant.

 -- It finally produces the following 4 plots.(*)

       1. Time Series
       2. Autocorrelation of the input time series samples
       3. Power Specrum - Depicting the power at different frequencies.,
       4. Cumulative Power Spectrum.
       
  --- A file named Details containing statistical values such as mean,
      standard deviation and 60% quantile frequency is created.

       Examples :

       ./spectrum -f attack_1
       The time series is present in the file attack_1
  
       The plot produced is stored in a file "4plot.ps"

       * This tool uses Ghost-view to view the plots.

INSTALLATION OF FFTW LIBRARY
----------------------------

This tool requires the fftw library to be installed as it uses fftw to 
find the fast fourier transform of a set of samples.

To install the library.

1.Link : www.fftw.org/fftw-3.0.1.tar.gz
  Also this source is provided with the spectrum source files. 
 
2.Compile the source code using the GNU-Build tools..

3.The generated files libfftw3.a and fftw3.h needs to be copied to the directory  in which the spectrum-0.1 distribution files are present.
