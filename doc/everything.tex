is LBNL's \underline{N}etwork \underline{S}imulator \cite{ns}.
The simulator is written in C++;
it uses OTcl as a command and configuration interface.
\ns~v2 has three substantial changes from \ns~v1:
(1) the more complex objects in \ns~v1
    have been decomposed into simpler components
    for greater flexibility and composability;
(2) the configuration interface is now OTcl, 
    an object oriented version of Tcl; and
(3) the interface code to the OTcl interpreter is
    separate from the main simulator.

In this document,
we use the term ``interpreter''
to be synonymous with the OTcl interpreter.
The code to interface with the interpreter resides
in a separate directory, \code{Tcl}.
The rest of the simulator code resides in the directory, \code{ns-2}.
We will use the notation \Tclf{\tup{file}}\
to refer to a particular \tup{file}\ in the
\code{Tcl}\ directory.
Similarly, we will use the notation, \nsf{\tup{file}}
to refer to a particular \tup{file}\ in the \code{ns-2} directory.
