This section describes the usage and the internals of multicast
routing implementation in \ns.
We first describe 
\href{the user interface to enable multicast routing}{Section}{sec:mcast-api},
specify the multicast routing protocol to be used and the
various methods and configuration parameters specific to the
protocols currently supported in \ns.
We then describe in detail 
\href{the internals and the architecture of the
multicast routing implementation in \ns}{Section}{sec:mcast-internals}.

The procedures and functions described in this chapter can be found in
various files in the directories \nsf{tcl/mcast}, \nsf{tcl/ctr-mcast},
in the files \nsf{ctrmcast.\{cc, h\}}, and \nsf{prune.\{cc, h\}};
additional support routines
are in \nsf{tcl/lib/ns-lib.tcl}, and \nsf{tcl/lib/ns-node.tcl}.

\section{Multicast API}
\label{sec:mcast-api}

Multicast routing is enabled in the simulation by setting 
the class Simulator class variable \code{EnableMcast_} to 1
before any node, link or agent objects are created.
This is so that the subsequently created 
node, link and agent objects are appropriately
configured during creation to support multicast routing.
For example the link objects are created with interface labels that
are required by some multicast routing protocols, 
node objects are created with the 
appropriate multicast classifier objects
and agent objects are made to point to the 
appropriate classifier at that node.

A multicast routing strategy is the mechanism by which the multicast
distribution tree is computed in the simulation.  The multicast
routing strategy or protocol to be used is specified through the
instance procedure \proc[]{mrtproto} in the class Simulator.
A handle is returned to an object that has methods
and configuration parameters specific to a particular multicast
routing strategy or protocol.  A null string is returned otherwise.
There are currently 4 multicast routing strategies in \ns: Centralized
Multicast, static Dense Mode, dynamic Dense Mode (\ie, adapts to
network changes), Protocol Independent Multicast---Dense Mode.
Currently only Centralized Multicast returns an object that has
methods and configuration parameters. Subsequent arguments to command
procedure \proc[]{mrtproto} specify the nodes that will run the
instance of multicast routing strategy.
The default is to run the same multicast routing
protocol on all the nodes in the topology. As an example, the
following commands illustrate the use of procedure \proc[]{mrtproto} command.
\begin{program}
        set cmc [$ns mrtproto CtrMcast \{\}]    \; specify centralized multicast for all nodes;
        \; cmc is the handle for multicast protocol object;
        $ns mrtproto DM $n1 $n2 $n3             \; specify dense mode multicast for nodes n1, n2 and n3;
        $ns mrtproto dynamicDM                  \; specify dynamic dense mode;
\end{program}

New/unused multicast address can be allocated using the procedure
\proc[]{allocaddr}. With default configuration ns can provide multicast
support for only 128 nodes. This bound on number of nodes is due to
the addressing scheme. The procedure \proc[]{expandaddr} can be used to
expand the address space if the number of nodes in simulation is more
than 128. \proc[]{allocaddr} and \proc[]{expandaddr} are class
procedures in the class Node.

The agents use the instance procedures
\proc[]{join-group} and \proc[]{leave-group}, in
the class Node to join and leave multicast groups. These procedures
take two mandatory arguments. The first argument identifies the
corresponding agent and second argument specifies the group address.

An example of a relatively simple multicast configuration is:
\begin{program}
        set ns [new Simulator]
        {\bfseries{}Simulator set EnableMcast_ 1} \; enable multicast routing;
        Node expandaddr  \; expand address space, required if more than 128 nodes;
        set group [{\bfseries{}Node allocaddr}]   \; allocate a mulicast address;
        set node0 [$ns node]         \; create multicast capable nodes;
        set node1 [$ns node]
        {\bfseries{}Simulator set NumberInterfaces_ 1}  \; number interfaces for all links;
        $ns duplex-link $n0 $n1 1.5Mb 10ms DropTail \; create links with interfaces;

        set mproto dynamicDM          \; configure multicast protocol;
        set mrthandle [{\bfseries{}$ns mrtproto $mproto \{\}}] \; if an empty list is give,;
                \; all nodes will contain multicast protocol agents;
        set src [new Agent/CBR]        \; create a source agent at node 0;
        $ns attach-agent $node0 $src 
        {\bfseries{}$src set dst_ $group}

        set rcvr [new Agent/LossMonitor]  \; create a receiver agent at node 1;
        $ns attach-agent $node1 $rcvr
        $ns at 0.3 "{\bfseries{}$node1 join-group $rcvr $group}" \; join the group at simulation time 0.3 (sec);
\end{program}

\subsection{Multicast Behavior Monitor Configuration}
\ns\ supports a multicast monitor module that can trace
some types of packet activity about a specific source group pair.
The module counts the number of packets in transit periodically
and prints the results to stdout. \proc[]{trace-topo} counts
all links.  \proc[]{trace-tree} counts only links on the tree.
Currently, it only traces prune, join, register, and data packets.

\begin{program}
        set mcastmonitor [$ns McastMonitor]
        $mcastmonitor set period_ 0.02         \; default 0.03 (sec);
        $mcastmonitor trace-topo $src $group   \; trace the entire topology;
\end{program}

}

\subsection{Protocol Specific configuration}

In this section, we briefly illustrate the
protocol specific configuration mechanisms
for all the protocols implemented in \ns.

\paragraph{Centralized Multicast}
The centralized multicast is a sparse mode implementation of multicast
similar to PIM-SM \cite{Deer94a:Architecture}.
A Rendezvous Point (RP) rooted shared tree is built
for a multicast group.  The actual sending of prune, join messages
etc. to set up state at the nodes is not simulated.  A centralized
computation agent is used to compute the fowarding trees and set up
multicast forwarding state, \tup{S, G} at the relevant nodes as new
receivers join a group.  Data packets from the senders to a group are
unicast to the RP.  Note that data packets from the senders are
unicast to the RP even if there are no receivers for the group.

Note that whenever network dynamics occur or unicast routing changes,
\proc[]{compute-mroutes} could be invoked to recompute the multicast routes.
The instantaneous re-computation feature of centralised algorithms
may result in causality violations during the transient
periods.  Thus, centralised multicast routing strategies are not
ideal for studying transient behaviours.

The method of enabling centralised multicast routing in a simulation is:
\begin{program}
        set mproto CtrMcast    \; set multicast protocol;
        set mrthandle [$ns mrtproto $mproto \{\}]
\end{program}
The command procedure \proc[]{mrtproto}
returns a handle to the multicast protocol object.
This handle can be used to control the RP and the boot-strap-router (BSR),
switch tree-types for a particular group,
from shared trees to source specific trees or vice-versa, and
recompute multicast routes.
\begin{program}
        $mrthandle set_c_rp \{$node0 $node1\}      \; set the RPs;
        $mrthandle set_c_bsr \{$node0:0 $node1:1\} \; set the BSR, specified as list of node:priority;

        $mrthandle get_c_rp $node0 $group          \; get the current RP ???;
        $mrthandle get_c_bsr $node0                \; get the current BSR;

        $mrthandle switch-treetype $group         \; to source specific or shared tree;

        $mrthandle compute-mroutes       \; recompute routes; usually invoked automatically as needed;
\end{program}

\paragraph{Static Dense Mode}
The Static Dense Mode protocol is based on DVMRP \cite{rfc1075}
with the exception
that it does not adapt to network dynamics.  It uses parent-child
lists as in DVMRP to reduce the number of links over which the data
packets are broadcast.
At each node,
the implementation
 infers poison-reverse information
and
 computes the parent-child relationships 
 for that node by looking
at the unicast routing tables at each of the adjacent nodes.

  Prune messages for a particular group are sent
upstream by nodes in case they do not lead to any group members.
These prune messages instantiate prune state in the appropriate
upstream nodes to prevent multicast packets from being forwarded down
links that do not lead to any group members.  The prune state at the
nodes times out after a prune timeout value.  The prune timeout is a
class variable in DM and its value can be changed as shown below.
\begin{program}
        DM set PruneTimeout 0.3           \; default 0.5 (sec);
        set mproto DM
        set mrthandle [$ns mrtproto $mproto \{\}]
\end{program}
This multicast protocol computes parent-child relationships prior to
the start of simulation and does not respond to the topology
changes. It models group membership dynamics very well.

\paragraph{Dynamic dense mode}
This protocol implements a DVMRP-like dense mode protocol,
similar to DM described earlier.
However, this implementation is also capable of adapting to changes
in the topology.

As in the case of DM, a node in this implementation uses the
unicast routing tables at all of its adjacent neighbours to
compute its parent-child relationships%
\footnote{This is somewhat different from classic DVMRP, in that
the implementation does not actually send out route updates;
however, it infers the arrival of these updates from other events
and attempts to reduce memory usage through shared routing table information.}.
The multicast routes are computed periodically every
\code{ReportRouteTimeout} seconds.
They are also computed when netowrk dynamics triggers a notification,
or the node receives a unicast route update.
The last event is used as a signal of a neighbour sending a 
DVMRP-like unicast route update to notify multicast route changes at that
neighbour.
The class dynamicDM is
inherited from the class DM.
\begin{program}
        dynamicDM set PruneTimeout 0.3           \; default 0.5 (sec);
        dynamicDM set ReportRouteTimeout 0.5  \; default 1 (sec);
        set mproto dynamicDM
        set mrthandle [$ns mrtproto $mproto \{\}]
\end{program}

\paragraph{PIM dense mode}
The Protocol Independent Multicast Dense Mode implementation
does not compute any parent-child relationships.
Therefore, incoming  data packets at a node are broadcast
to all outgoing links except the link that the packet came over.
Neighbours send prune messages if they have no listeners
at that node or downstream of them.
The prune timeout value is 0.5s by default.
This class pimDM is inherited from the class DM.
\begin{program}
        pimDM set PruneTimeout  0.3     \; default 0.5 (sec);
        set mproto pimDM
        set mrthandle [$ns mrtproto $mproto \{\}]
\end{program}

\section{Internals of multicast routing}
\label{sec:mcast-internals}

We first describe the main classes that are used to implement multicast
routing and then describe how each multicast routing strategy
or protocol is implemented.

\subsection{The classes}
The main classes in the implementation are
the \clsref{McastProtoArbiter}{../ns-2/tcl/mcast/McastProto.tcl} and
the \clsref{McastProtocol}{../ns-2/tcl/mcast/McastProto.tcl}.
The class McastProtocol is the base
class for the various multicast routing strategy and protocol objects.
In addition some methods and configuration parameters have been defined in
the Simulator, Node, Classifier, and Replicator objects for multicast
routing.

\paragraph{McastProtoArbiter class}
There is one McastProtoArbiter object per multicast capable node.
Each  McastProtoArbiter object maintain a list of multicast protocols.
This arbiter supports the ability for a node to run multiple multicast
routing protocols.
However, most simulations in \ns\ appear to be
configured with one multicast routing protocol for the entire simulations.

Whenever there is a multicast related action in a node, the
node will access its multicast protcols through this McastProtoArbiter.

Basic functions are \proc[]{join-group}, \proc[]{leave-group}, and
\proc[]{upcall}.
These functions translate into calls to corresponding functions of the
same name in each of the multicast protocols running at that node.

\paragraph{McastProtocol class}
This is the base class for the implementation of all the multicast protocols.
It contains basic multicast functions:
\proc[]{join-group}, \proc[]{leave-group},
\proc[]{handle-cache-miss}, \proc[]{handle-wrong-iif}, \proc[]{drop}.
Protocol specific actions are appropriately redefined
by the individual multicast protocols that inherit these functions.

\subsection{Extensions to other classes in \ns}
We have already described the simulator class variable
\code{EnableMcast_} to enable multicast simulations.
In 
\href{the earlier chapter describing nodes in \ns}{Chapter}{chap:nodes},
we described the internal structure of the node in \ns.
To briefly recap that description, the node entry for a multicast node is
the \code{switch_}.  It looks at the highest bit to decide
 if the destination is a multicast or unicast packet.
 Multicast packets are forwarded to a multicast
classifier which maintains a list of replicators;
there is one replicator per \tup{source, group, incoming interface} tuple.
Replicators copy the incoming packet and forward to all outgoing interfaces.

When a node receives a join-group message,
\proc[]{Node::join-group} is invoked, that then invokes
the arbiter instance's
\proc[]{join-group}.
The node stores a reference to the McastProtoArbiter at that node in
its instance variable \code{mcastproto_}.
After the arbiter has returned, the node
adds the appropriate receiver agents to its list of \code{Agents_},
and adds the outgoing interfaces to all the replicators for that group.

\proc[]{Node::leave-group} reverses the process described earlier.
It disables the outgoing interfaces to the receiver agents
for all the replicators of the group,
deletes the receiver agents from the local \code{Agents_} list; it then
invokes the arbiter instance's 
\proc[]{leave-group}.

When a multicast data packet is received, and the multicast
classifier cannot find the slot corresponding to that data packet,
it calls \proc[]{Node::new-group}.
This procedure notifies the arbiter instance to establish the new group.

\proc[]{Node::add-mfc} adds a multicast forwarding cache entry for
a particular \tup{source, group, iif}.
The mechanism is:
(1) create a new replicator (if one does not already exist),
(2) update the \code{replicator_} and \code{repByGroup_}
 instance variable arrays at the node,
(3) adds all outgoing interfaces and local agents
to the appropriate replicator,
and finally,
(4) invoke the multicast classifier's \proc[]{add-rep}
 to create a slot for the replicator in the multicast classifier.

\paragraph{Class Classifier}
There is once multicast classifier per node.
The node stores a reference to this classifier in its instance variable
\code{multiclassifier_}.
When this classifier receives a packet,
it looks at the \tup{source, group} information in the packet headers,
and the interface that the packet arrived from (the incoming interface or iif);
using that information, the classifier will identify the slot
that should be used to forward that packet.  The slot will point
to the appropriate replicator.

However, if the slot is invalid, or the classifier does not have an
entry for this \tup{source, group, iif},
then it will invoke \proc[]{new-group} for the classifier,
with one of two codes to identify the problem.
\code{CACHE_MISS} indicates that the classifier did not find any
\tup{source, group} entries;
\code{WRONG_IIF} indicates that the classifier found \tup{source, group}
entries, but none matching the interface that this packet arrived over.
In this situation, this particular data is dropped.

The classifier \proc[]{new-group} invokes \proc[]{Node::new-group}
to create the group entries.

\proc[]{add-rep} creates a slot in the classifier
and adds a replicator for \tup{source, group, iif} to that slot.

\paragraph{Class Replicator}
When a replicator receives a packet,
it copies the packet to all of its slots.
Each slot points to an outgoing interface for a particular 
\tup{source, group, iif}.
If no slot is found, the C++ replicator invokes the class 
instance procedure \proc[]{drop} to
trigger protocol specific actions.
We will describe the protocol specific actions in the next section,
when we describe the internal procedures of each of the 
multicast routing protocols.

There are instance procedures to control the elements in each slot:
\begin{alist}
\proc[oif]{insert} & inserting a new outgoing interface
                        to the next available slot.\\
\proc[oif]{disable} & disable the slot pointing to the specified oif.\\
\proc[oif]{enable} &  enable the slot pointing to the specified oif.\\
\proc[]{is-active} & returns true if the replicator has at least one active slot.\\
\proc[oif]{exists} & returns true if the slot pointing to the specified oif is active.\\
\proc[source, group, oldiif, newiif]{change-iface} & modified the iif entry for the particular replicator.\\
\end{alist}

\subsection{Protocol Internals}
\label{sec:mcastproto-internals}

We now describe the implementation of
the different multicast routing protocol agents.

\subsubsection{Centralized Multicast}
\begin{list}{}{}
\item
\code{CtrMcast} is inherited from \code{McastProtocol}.
One CtrMcast agent needs to be created for each node.
This CtrMcast agent handles multicast commands for the node it is
attached to;
\eg, \proc[]{join-group}, 
\proc[]{leave-group}, and \proc[]{handle-cache-miss}.
When multicast forwarding entries need to be updated, it calls a 
global, unique CtrMcastComp
(centralized multicast computation) agent to compute and install the new
entries.
We will describe the centralised multicast computation details
in the followingparagraphs.

--- 
\proc[]{join-group} adds the node to the instance variable
\code{Mlist} of the instance of \code{CtrMcastComp}.
\proc[]{join-group}
then calls the CtrMcastComp agent, \code{Agent}, to compute the branches
for this node to reach all existing sources.

---
\proc[]{leave-group} is the reverse of \proc[]{join-group}

---
\proc[]{handle-cache-miss} is called when no proper forwarding entry is
found for a particular packet source.
In case of centralized multicast,
it means a new source has started sending data packets.
Thus, the new source is added to the instance variable \code{Slist}
of the instance of \code{CtrMcastComp}.
If there are members in \code{Mlist},
the new multicast tree will be computed.
In the case that the particular
group is in RPT(shared tree) mode, an encapsulation agent is created at the
source; 
a corresponding decapsulation agent is created at the RP;
the two agents are connected by unicast, and the \tup{S,G} entry points
its outgoing interface to the encapsulation agent.
\item
\code{CtrMcastComp} is the centralised multicast route computation agent.
\begin{alist}
\proc[]{reset-mroutes} & resets all mutlicast forwarding entries.\\
\proc[]{compute-mroutes} & (re)computes all multicast forwarding entries.\\
\proc[source, group]{compute-tree} & computes a multicast tree for one source to reach 
                all the receivers in a specific group.\\
\proc[source, group, member]{compute-branch} & is executed when a receiver joins a multicast group.
        It could also be invoked by \proc[]{compute-tree} when it itself
        is recomputing the multicast tree, and has to reparent
        all receivers.
        The algorithm starts at the receiver, recursively
        finding successive next hops,
        until it either reaches the source or RP,
        or it reaches a node that is already 
        a part of the relevent multicast tree.
         During the process, several new replicators and an
        outgoing interface will be installed.\\
\proc[source, group, member]{prune-branch} & is similar to \proc[]{compute-branch} except the
        outgoing interface is disabled;
        if the outgoing interface list is empty at that node,
        it will walk up the multicast tree, pruning at each of the
        intermediate nodes, until it reaches a node that has a
        non-empty outgoing interface list for the particular multicast tree.
\end{alist}
\end{list}

\subsubsection{Dense Mode}
\begin{alist}
\proc[group]{join-group} & sends graft messages upstream if \tup{S,G} does not
        contain any active outgoing slots (\ie, no downstream receivers).\\
\proc[group]{leave-group} & does not do anything.\\
\proc[group]{handle-cache-miss} & creates \tup{S,G} with only
        the outgoing interfaces to each of the child nodes.
        For basic dense mode,
        parent-child relationship is computed only once at the start-up.\\
 &      However, for dynamic dense mode,
        the incoming interface must be set properly so packets from the
        wrong incoming interfaces will be dropped. \\
 &      Finally, in the case of pim dense mode, 
        \proc[]{handle-cache-miss} is the same as in dynamic dense mode,
        except that the outgoing interface list is set to all neighbours
        excluding the incoming interface.\\
\proc[replicator, source, group]{drop} & sends prune messages upstream.
        Recall that the packet is only dropped when there are
        no downstream receivers for the \tup{S, G} tuple.\\
\proc[from, source, group]{recv-prune} & resets the prune timer
         if the interface had been pruned previously;
        otherwise, it starts the prune timer and disables the interface;
        furthermore,  if the outgoing interface list becomes empty,
        it forwards the prune message upstream.\\
\proc[from, source, group]{recv-graft} & cancels any existing prune timer, and
        re-enables the pruned interface.
        If the outgoing interface list was previously empty,
        it forwards the graft upstream.\\
\proc[]{periodic-check} & This procedure is only used in dynamic dense mode.
        Each node periodically updates its parent-child relationships
        with respect to each of its neighbours.\\
proc[]{handle-wrong-iif} & This proceudre is only used by PIM dense mode.
        This is invoked when the multicast classifier drops a packet
        because it arrived on the wrong interface, and
        invoked \proc[]{new-group}.
        This routine is invoked by \proc[]{McastProtoArbiter::new-group}.
        When invoked, the agent checks if the incoming interface in the
        forwarding entry has become outdated.
        If so, this procedure will update the forwarding entry to the
        new incoming interface;
        otherwise, it will send a prume message back towards the
        wrong incoming interface to stop packets
        reaching from the wrong path.
\end{alist}
