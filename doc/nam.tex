\section{Animations from nam}

Nam animations can be saved and converted to animated gifs or MPEG movies.

To save the frames of your movie, first
  start nam with your trace and set it up where you want it to start
  and adjust other parameters (step rate, size, etc.)
Select ``record animation'' in the File menu to start saving frames.
Each animation step will be saved in a X-window dump file called ``nam\%d.xwd''
  where \%d is the frame number.

The following shell script (sh, not csh)
  converts these files into an animated gif:
\begin{verbatim}
for i in *.xwd; do
	xwdtoppm <$i |
	ppmtogif -interlace -transparent'#e5e5e5' >`basename $i .xwd`.gif;
done
gifmerge -l0 -2 -229,229,229 *.gif >movie.gif
\end{verbatim}

Please note that these programs (xwdtoppm, ppmtogif, gifmerge)
  are \emph{not} part of ns.
You can get the first two from \url{http://download.sourceforge.net/netpbm/}
  and gifmerge from \url{http://www.the-labs.com/GIFMerge/}.
