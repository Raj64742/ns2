\chapter{Links: Simple Links}
\label{chap:links}

This is the second aspect of defining the topology.
In \href{the previous chapter}{Chapter}{chap:nodes},
we had described how to create the nodes in the topology in \ns.
We now describe how to create the links to connect the nodes and complete
the topology.
In this chapter, we restrict ourselves to describing the simple
point to point links.
\ns\ supports a variety of other media, including
an emulation of a multi-access LAN using a mesh of simple links,
and other true simulation of wireless and broadcast media.
They will be described in a separate chapter.
The CBQlink is derived from simple links and is a considerably more
complex form of link that is also not described in this chapter.

We begin by describing the commands to create a link in this section.
As with the node being composed of classifiers, 
a simple link is built up from a sequence of connectors.
We also briefly describe some of the connectors in a simple link.
We then describe
\href{the instance procedures that operate on the various components of
defined by some of these connectors}{Section}{sec:links:components}.
We conclude the chapter
\href{with a description the connector object}{Section}{sec:links:connectors},
including brief
descriptions of the common link connectors.

The \clsref{Link}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}
is a standalone class in OTcl,
that provides a few simple primitives.
The \clsref{SimpleLink}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}
provides the ability to connect two nodes with a point to point link.
\ns\ provides the instance procedure
\fcnref{\proc[]{simplex-link}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Simulator::simplex-link}
to form a unidirectional link from one node to another.
The link is in the class SimpleLink.
The following describes the syntax of the simplex link:
\begin{program}
    set ns [new Simulator]
    $ns simplex-link \tup{node0} \tup{node1} \tup{bandwidth} \tup{delay} \tup{queue_type}
\end{program}
The command creates a link from \code{\tup{node0}} to \code{\tup{node1}},
with specified \code{\tup{bandwidth}} and \code{\tup{delay}} characteristics.
The link uses a queue of type \code{\tup{queue_type}}.
The procedure also adds a TTL checker to the link.
Five instance variables define the link:

\centerline{\begin{tabular}{rp{4in}}
	\code{head\_} &	Entry point to the link, it points
			to the first object in the link. \\
	\code{queue\_} & Reference to the main queue element of the link.
			Simple links usually have one queue per link.
			Other more complex types of links may have multiple
			queue elements in the link. \\
	\code{link\_} &	A reference to the element
			that actually models the link,
			in terms of the delay and bandwidth characteristics
			of the link. \\
	\code{ttl\_} &	Reference to the element that manipulates the
			ttl in every packet. \\
	\code{drophead\_} & Reference to an object that is the head of a
			queue of elements that process link drops. \\
	    \end{tabular}}

In addition, if the simulator instance variable, 
\code{$traceAllFile_}, is defined, 
the procedure will add trace elements that track when a packet is
enqueued and dequeued from \code{queue_}.
Furthermore, tracing interposes a drop trace element after the
\code{drophead_}.
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centerline{\includegraphics{link}}
  \caption{Composite Construction of a Unidirectional Link}
  \label{fig:link}
\end{figure}
The following instance variables track the trace elements:

\centerline{\begin{tabular}{rp{4in}}
	\code{enqT\_} &	Reference to the element that traces
			packets entering \code{queue\_}.\\
	\code{deqT\_} &	Reference to the element that traces
			packets leaving \code{queue\_}.\\
	\code{drpT\_} &	Reference to the element that traces
			packets dropped from \code{queue\_}.\\
	    \end{tabular}}

Note however, that if the user enable tracing multiple times on the link,
these instance variables will only store a reference to the
last elements inserted.

Other configuration mechanisms that add components to a simple link
are network interfaces (used in multicast routing), 
link dynamics models, and tracing and monitors.
We give 
\href{a brief overview of the related objects at the end of this chapter}{%
		Section}{sec:links:connectors},
and discuss their functionality/implementation in other chapters.

The instance procedure
\fcnref{\proc[]{duplex-link}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Simulator::duplex-link}
constructs a bi-directional link from two simplex links.

\section{Instance Procedures for Links and SimpleLinks}
\label{sec:links:components}

\paragraph{Link procedures}
The \clsref{Link}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl} is implemented entirely in Otcl.
The OTcl \code{SimpleLink} class uses the C++ \code{LinkDelay} class
to simulate packet delivery delays.
The instance procedures in the class Link are:

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{rX}
\fcnref{\proc[]{head}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::head} &
		returns the handle for \code{head\_}. \\
\fcnref{\proc[]{queue}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::queue} &
		returns the handle for \code{queue\_}. \\
\fcnref{\proc[]{link}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::link} &
		returns the handle for the delay element, \code{link\_}. \\
\fcnref{\proc[]{up}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::up} &
		set link status to ``up'' in the \code{dynamics\_} element.
		Also, writes out a trace line to each file specified through
		the procedure \proc[]{trace-dynamics}.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{down}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::down} &
		As with \proc[]{up},
		set link status to ``down'' in the \code{dynamics\_} element.
		Also, writes out a trace line to each file specified through
		the procedure \proc[]{trace-dynamics}.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{up?}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::up?} &
		returns status of the link.   Status is ``up'' or ``down'';
		status is ``up'' if link dynamics is not enabled.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{all-connectors}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::all-connectors} &
		Apply specified operation to all connectors on the link.p
		An example of such usage is \code{\$link all-connectors reset}.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{cost}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::cost} &
		set link cost to value specified.\\
\fcnref{\proc[]{cost?}}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}{Link::cost?} &
		returns the cost of the link.  Default cost of link is 1, 
		if no cost has been specified earlier.\\
\end{tabularx}

\paragraph{SimpleLink Procedures}
The Otcl \clsref{SimpleLink}{../ns-2/ns-link.tcl}
implements a simple point-to-point
link with an associated queue and delay\footnote{The current
version also includes an object to examine the
network layer ``ttl'' field and discard packets if the
field reaches zero.}.
It is derived from the base Otcl class Link as follows:
\begin{program}
        Class SimpleLink -superclass Link
        SimpleLink instproc init \{ src dst bw delay q \{ lltype "DelayLink" \} \} \{
                $self next $src $dst
                $self instvar link_ queue_ head_ toNode_ ttl_
                ...
                set queue_ $q
                set link_ [new Delay/Link]
                $link_ set bandwidth_ $bw
                $link_ set delay_ $delay

                $queue_ target $link_
                $link_ target [$toNode_ entry]

                ...
                # XXX
                # put the ttl checker after the delay
                # so we don't have to worry about accounting
                # for ttl-drops within the trace and/or monitor
                # fabric
                #
                set ttl_ [new TTLChecker]
                $ttl_ target [$link_ target]
                $link_ target $ttl_
        \}
\end{program}
Notice that when a \code{SimpleLink} object is created,
new \code{Delay/Link} and \code{TTLChecker} objects are
also created.
Note also that,
the \code{Queue} object must have already been created.

There are two additional methods implemented (in OTcl) as part
of the \code{SimpleLink} class: \code{trace} and \code{init-monitor}.
These functions are described in further detail
\href{in the section on tracing}{Chapter}{chap:trace}. 

\section{Connectors}
\label{sec:links:connectors}

Connectors, unlink  classifiers, only generate data for one recipient;
either the packet is delivered to the \code{target_} neighbor, or it
is sent to he \code{drop-target_}.

A connector will receive a packet, perform some function,
and deliver the packet to its neighbor, or drop the packet.
There are a number of different types of connectors in \ns.
Each connector performs a different function.

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{rX}
networkinterface & labels packets with incoming interface identifier---it 
			is used by some multicast routing protocols.
			The class variable ``Simulator NumberInterfaces\_ 1''
			tells \ns\ to add these interfaces, and then, it is
			added to either end of the simplex link.
			\href{Multicast routing protocols are discussed in
				a separate chapter}{Chapter}{chap:multicast}.\\
DynaLink &	Object that gates traffic depending on whether the link 
		is up or down.  It expects to be at the head of the link,
		and is inserted on the link just prior to simulation start.
		It's \code{status\_} variable control whether the link is
		up or down.
		\href{The description of how the DynaLink object is used
		is in a separate chapter}{Chapter}{chap:net-dynamics}.\\
DelayLink &	Object that models the link's
		delay and bandwidth characteristics.
		If the link is not dynamic, then this object simply
		schedules receive events for the downstream object
		for each packet it receives at the appropriate time
		for that packet.  However, if the link is dynamic,
		then it queues the packets internally, and schedules
		one receives event for itself for the next packet that must
		be delivered.
		Thus, if the link goes down at some point, this object's
	 \fcnref{\fcn[]{reset} method}{../ns-2/delay.cc}{DelayLink::reset}
		is invoked, and the object will drop all packets in transit
		at the instant of link failure.
		We discuss the
		\href{specifics of this class in another chapter}{Chapter}{%
			chap:delays}.\\
Queues &	model the output buffers attached
		to a link in a ``real'' router in a network.
		In \ns, they are attached to, and 
		are considered as part of the link.
		We discuss the
		\href{details of queues and different types of queues in \ns
			in another chapter}{Chapter}{chap:qmgmt}.\\
TTLChecker &	will decrement the ttl in each packet that it receives.
		If that ttl then has a positive value, the packet is forwarded
		to the next element on the link.  In the simple links,
		TTLCheckers are automatically added, and are placed
		as the last element on the link, between the delay element,
		and the entry for the next node.\\
\end{tabularx}
