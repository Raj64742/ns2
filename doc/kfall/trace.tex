\section{\shdr{Trace and Monitoring Support}{trace.h}{sec:trace}}

There are a number of ways of collecting output or
trace data on a simulation.
Generally all data is stored in a file to be analyzed
after completion of a simulation.
Trace objects are configured into a simulation as nodes in the
network topology, usually with a Tcl ``Channel'' object
hooked to them, representing the destination of collected data
(typically a trace file in the current directory).
There are really two parts to the tracing support: individual
packet traces and derived statistics.

To support packet traces, there is a special trace header
included in each packet (this format is defined in \code{trace.h}).
It presently includes a unique identifier on each packet and a
packet type field (set by agents when they generate packets).
This packet type field is not currently otherwise used by the simulator.
This trace facility has been inherited from an earlier version of the
simulator and produces output traces compatible with \code{ns} version 1.

To support the collection of aggregated statistics, a separate
set of objects is created and inserted into the network topology
around queues.
They provide a place where
arrival statistics and times are gathered and make
use of the \code{Integrator} class (see \ref{sec:integclass}) to
compute statistics over time intervals.

\subsection{\shdr{Otcl Trace and Monitor Support}{ns-lib.tcl}{sec:otcltrace}}

The trace support in OTcl consists of a number of specialized
classes visible in OTcl but implemented in C++, combined
with a set of Tcl helper procedures and classes defined in the ns library.

\subsubsection{\shdr{OTcl trace classes}{ns-lib.tcl}{sec:traceclass}}
The following OTcl classes are supported by underlying C++
classes defined in \code{trace.cc}:
\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
	\item [Trace/Hop] - trace a ``hop'' (XXX what does this mean exactly; it is not really used XXX)
	\item [Trace/Enque] - packet arrival at a queue
	\item [Trace/Deque] - packet departure at a queue
	\item [Trace/Drop] - packet drop at a queue (delivered to drop-target)
	\item [SnoopQueue/In] - on input, collect a time/size sample (pass packet on)
	\item [SnoopQueue/Out] - on output, collect a time/size sample (pass packet on)
	\item [QueueMonitor] - receive and aggregate collected samples from snoopers
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{\shdr{otcl helper functions}{ns-lib.tcl}{sec:helptrace}}
The following helper functions may be used within simulation
scripts to help in attaching trace elements (see \code{ns-lib.tcl}):
\begin{small}

        }

        Simulator instproc drop-trace { n1 n2 trace } {

        }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
XXX this is confusing XXXX
The \code{create-trace} procedure is used to create a new \code{Trace}
object of the appropriate kind and attach an I/O channel to it
(typically a file handle).
The \code{src\_} and \code{dst\_} fields are bound to underlying C++
variables so that trace output can include the node addresses between
which the tracing is taking place.
Note that they are not used for {\em matching}.  Specifically, these
values in no way relate to the packet header \code{src} and \code{dst}
fields, which are also displayed when tracing.
See the description of the \code{Trace}
class below (\ref{sec:traceclass}).

The \code{trace-queue} function enables
\code{Enque}, \code{Deque}, and \code{Drop} tracing on the link
between nodes \code{n1} and \code{n2}.
The reference \verb!$link_([$n1 id]:[$n2 id])! inspects the master
table of links stored in the associative array \code{link\_} and provides
a reference to the link connecting the nodes with the IDs associated
with \code{n1} and \code{n2}.
The Link \code{trace} procedure is described below (\ref{sec:libexam}).

The \code{monitor-queue} function is constructed similarly to
\code{trace-queue}.
By calling the link's \code{init-monitor} procedure, it arranges
for the creation of objects (\code{SnoopQueue} and \code{QueueMonitor}
objects) which can, in turn, be used to ascertain time-aggregated
queue statistics.

The \code{drop-trace} function provides a way to specify a
\code{Queue}'s drop target without having a direct handle of
the queue.

\subsubsection{\shdr{Library support and examples}{ns-lib.tcl}{sec:libexam}}

The \code{Simulator} procedures described above require the \code{trace}
and \code{init-monitor} methods associated with the OTcl \code{Link} class.
At the moment, only one subclass of link is defined, namely
\code{SimpleLink}.  Thus, the \code{trace} and \code{init-monitor}
methods are actually part of the \code{SimpleLink} class rather than
the \code{Link} base class.
The \code{trace} function is defined as follows (in \code{ns-link.tcl}):
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        #
        # Build trace objects for this link and
        # update the object linkage
        #
        SimpleLink instproc trace { ns f } {
                $self instvar enqT_ deqT_ drpT_ queue_ link_ head_ fromNode_ toNode_
                set enqT_ [$ns create-trace Enque $f $fromNode_ $toNode_]
                set deqT_ [$ns create-trace Deque $f $fromNode_ $toNode_]
                set drpT_ [$ns create-trace Drop $f $fromNode_ $toNode_]

                $drpT_ target [$queue_ drop-target]
                $queue_ drop-target $drpT_

                $deqT_ target [$queue_ target]
                $queue_ target $deqT_

                $enqT_ target $head_
                set head_ $enqT_
        }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

This function establishes \code{Enque}, \code{Deque}, and \code{Drop}
traces in the simulator \code{\$ns} and directs their
output to I/O handle \code{\$f}.
The function assumes a queue has been associated with the link.
It operates by first creating three new trace objects
and inserting the \code{Enque} object before the queue, the
\code{Deque} object after the queue, and the \code{Drop} object
between the queue and its previous drop target.
Note that all trace output is directed to the same I/O handle.

The \code{init-monitor} function is used to create a set of
objects used to monitor queue sizes of a queue associated
with a link.
It is defined as follows:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        #
        # Insert objects that allow us to monitor the queue size
        # of this link.  Return the name of the object that
        # can be queried to determine the average queue size.
        #
        SimpleLink instproc init-monitor ns {
                $self instvar drpT_ queue_ head_ \
                        snoopIn_ snoopOut_ snoopDrop_ qMonitor_

                set snoopIn_ [new SnoopQueue/In]
                set snoopOut_ [new SnoopQueue/Out]
                set snoopDrop_ [new SnoopQueue/Out]

                $snoopIn_ target $head_
                set head_ $snoopIn_

                $snoopOut_ target [$queue_ target]
                $queue_ target $snoopOut_

                if [info exists drpT_] {
                        $snoopDrop_ target [$drpT_ target]
                        $drpT_ target $snoopDrop_
                } else {
                        $snoopDrop_ target [$ns set nullAgent_]
                }
                $queue_ drop-target $snoopDrop_

                set qMonitor_ [new QueueMonitor]
                $snoopIn_ set-monitor $qMonitor_
                $snoopOut_ set-monitor $qMonitor_
                $snoopDrop_ set-monitor $qMonitor_

                return $qMonitor_
        }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

This function establishes queue monitoring on the \code{SimpleLink} object
in the simulator \code{ns}.
Queue monitoring is implemented by constructing three \code{SnoopQueue}
objects and one \code{QueueMonitor} object.
The \code{SnoopQueue} objects are linked in around a \code{Queue} in a way
similar to \code{Trace} objects.
The \code{SnoopQueue/In(Out)} object monitors packet arrivals(departures)
and reports them to an associated \code{QueueMonitor} agent.
In addition, a \code{SnoopQueue/Out} object is also used to accumulate
packet drop statistics to an associated \code{QueueMonitor} object.
For \code{init-monitor} the same \code{QueueMonitor} object is used
in all cases.
The C++ definitions of the \code{SnoopQueue} and \code{QueueMonitor}
classes are described below.

\subsection{\shdr{C++ Trace and Monitor Support}{trace.cc}{sec:tracemoncplus}}

Underlying C++ objects are created in support of the interface specified
in Section\ref{sec:traceclass} and are linked into the network topology
as network elements.

\subsubsection{\shdr{the C++ Trace class}{trace.cc}{sec:tracecplus}}

The single C++ \code{Trace} class is used to implement the OTcl
classes \code{Trace/Hop}, \code{Trace/Enque}, \code{Trace/Deque},
and \code{Trace/Drop}.
The \code{type\_} field is used to differentiate among the
various types of
traces any particular \code{Trace} object might implement.
Currently, this field may contain one of the following symbolic characters:
{\bf +} for enque, {\bf -} for deque, {\bf h} for hop, and
{\bf d} for drop.
The overall class is defined as follows in \code{trace.cc}:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        class Trace : public Connector {
         protected:
                int type_;
                nsaddr_t src_;
                nsaddr_t dst_;
                Tcl_Channel channel_;
                int callback_;
                char wrk_[256];
                void format(int tt, int s, int d, Packet* p);
         public:
                Trace(int type);
                ~Trace();
                int command(int argc, const char*const* argv);
                void recv(Packet* p, Handler*);
                void dump();
                inline char* buffer() { return (wrk_); }
        };
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

The \code{src\_}, and \code{dst\_} internal state is used
to label trace output and is independent of the corresponding field
names in packet headers.
The main \code{recv} method is defined as follows:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        void Trace::recv(Packet* p, Handler* h)
        {
                format(type_, src_, dst_, p);
                dump();
                /* hack: if trace object not attached to anything free packet */
                if (target_ == 0)
                        Packet::free(p);
                else
                        send(p, h); /* Connector::send() */
        }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
The function merely formats a trace entry using the source, destination,
and particular trace type character.
The \code{dump} function writes the formatted entry out to the
I/O handle associated with \code{channel\_}.
The \code{format} function, in effect, dictates the trace file format.

\subsubsection{\shdr{trace file format}{trace.cc}{sec:traceformat}}

The \code{Trace::format} function defines the trace file format used
in trace files produced by the \code{Trace} class.
It is constructed to maintain backward compatibility with output files
in earlier versions of the simulator (i.e. {\em ns-1}) so that ns-1
post-processing scripts continue to operate.
The important pieces of its implementation are as follows:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        char* pt_names[] = {
                PT_NAMES
        };

        // this function should retain some backward-compatibility, so that
        // scripts don't break.
        void Trace::format(int tt, int s, int d, Packet* p)
        {
                TraceHeader *th = TraceHeader::access(p->bits());
                IPHeader *iph = IPHeader::access(p->bits());
                TCPHeader *tcph = TCPHeader::access(p->bits());
                const char* name = pt_names[th->ptype()];
                int seqno;
                /* XXX */
                if (strncmp(name, "tcp", 3) == 0)
                        seqno = tcph->seqno();
                else
                        seqno = -1;


                char flags[5];
                flags[0] = flags[1] = flags[2] = flags[3] = '-';
                flags[4] = 0;
                flags[0] = (iph->flags() & IP_ECN) ? 'C' : '-';
                sprintf(wrk_, "%c %g %d %d %s %d %s %d %d %d %d %d",
                        tt,
                        Scheduler::instance().clock(),
                        s,
                        d,
                        name,
                        iph->size(),
                        flags,
                        iph->flowid() /* was p->class_ */,
                        iph->src(),
                        iph->dst(),
                        seqno,
                        th->uid() /* was p->uid_ */);
        }
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
This function is somewhat unelegant, primarily due to the desire
to maintain backward compatibility.
It formats the source, destination, and type fields defined in the
trace object ({\em not in the packet headers}), the current time,
along with various packet header fields including,
type of packet (as a name), size, flags (symbolically),
flow identifier, source and destination packet header fields,
sequence number (if present), and unique identifier.
Thus, a fragment of a trace file might appear as follows:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        + 1.45176 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 1 256 769 27 48
        + 1.45276 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 1 256 769 28 49
        - 1.46176 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 1 256 769 22 43
        + 1.46176 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 1 256 769 29 50
        + 1.46276 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 1 256 769 30 51
        d 1.46276 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 1 256 769 30 51
        - 1.47176 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 1 256 769 23 44
        + 1.47176 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 0 0 768 3 52
        + 1.47276 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 0 0 768 4 53
        d 1.47276 2 3 tcp 1000 ---- 0 0 768 4 53
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
Here we see ten trace entries, 6 enque operations (indicated by ``+''
in the first column), 2 deque operations (indicated by ``-''),
and 2 packet drops (indicated by ``d'').
(this had better be a trace fragment, or 2 packets would have just vanished!).
The simulated time (in seconds) at which each event occurred is listed
in the second column.
The next two fields indicate between which two nodes tracing is happening.
The next field is a descriptive name for the the type of packet seen
(see \ref{sec:traceptype} below).
The next field is the packet's size, as encoded in its IP header.
The next four characters represent special flag bits which may be
enabled.  Presently only one such bit exists (explicit congestion
notification, or {\sf ECN}).  In this example, {\sf ECN} is not used.
The next field gives the IP {\em flow identifier} field as defined
for IP version 6.\footnote{In ns-1, each packet included a \code{class}
field, which was used by CBQ to classify packets.
It then found additional use to differentiate between
``flows'' at one trace point.  In ns-2, the flow ID field is available
for this purpose, but any additional information (which was commonly overloaded
into the class field in ns-1) should be placed in its own separate field,
possibly in some other header}.
The subsequent two fields indicate the packet's source and destination
node addresses, respectively.
The following field indicates the sequence number.\footnote{In ns-1,
all packets contained a sequence number, whereas in ns-2 only those
Agents interested in providing sequencing will generate sequence numbers.
Thus, this field may not be useful in ns-2 for packets generated by
agents that have not filled in a sequence number.  It is used here
to remain backward compatible with ns-1.}
The last field is a unique packet identifier.  Each new packet
created in the simulation is assigned a new, unique identifier.

\subsubsection{\shdr{packet types}{trace.h}{sec:traceptype}}

Each packet contains a packet type field used by \code{Trace::format}
to print out the type of packet encountered.
The type field is defined in the \code{TraceHeader} class, and is considered
to be part of the trace support; it is not interpreted
elsewhere in the simulator.
Initialization of the type field in packets is performed by the
\code{Agent::allocpkt()} function.
The type field is set to integer values associated with the
definition passed to the \code{Agent} constructor.
See Section~\ref{sec:agentmethodsotcl} for more details.
The currently-supported definitions, their values, and their
associated symblic names are as follows
(defined in \code{trace.h}):
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        #define PT_TCP          0
        #define PT_TELNET       1
        #define PT_CBR          2
        #define PT_AUDIO        3
        #define PT_VIDEO        4
        #define PT_ACK          5
        #define PT_START        6
        #define PT_STOP         7
        #define PT_PRUNE        8
        #define PT_GRAFT        9
        #define PT_MESSAGE      10
        #define PT_RTCP         11
        #define PT_RTP          12
        #define PT_NTYPE        13

        #define PT_NAMES "tcp", "telnet", "cbr", "audio", "video", "ack", \
                "start", "stop", "prune", "graft", "message", "rtcp", "rtp"
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
The definition of \code{PT\_NAMES} is used to initialize the
\code{pt\_names} array as indicated above;
\code{PT\_NTYPE} is not presently used.

\subsubsection{\shdr{queue monitoring}{queue-monitor.cc}{sec:qmonitor}}

Objects of three different classes are used to support monitoring
of queue occupancy.
A \code{QueueMonitor} object keeps running statistics, and
\code{SnoopQueue} objects receive packets and provide
a copy to a corresponding \code{QueueMonitor} object before forwarding
them downstream.
A \code{QueueMonitor} is defined as follows (\code{queue-monitor.cc}):
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        class QueueMonitor : public Integrator {
         public:
                QueueMonitor() : size_(0) {
                        bind("size_", &size_);
                }
                void in(Packet*);
                void out(Packet*);
                //      int command(int argc, const char*const* argv);
        protected:
                int size_;
        };
        void QueueMonitor::in(Packet* p)

The \code{QueueMonitor} class is derived from \code{Integrator}, which
is defined in Section\ref{sec:mathinteg}.
The \code{Integrator} class provides a simple implementation of
integral approximation by discrete sums.
In this case, a \code{QueueMonitor} computes the approximate integral of the
queue size (in bytes)
with respect to time over the interval $[t_0, now]$, where
$t_0$ is either the start of the simulation or the last time the
\code{sum\_} field of the underlying \code{Integrator} class was reset.
In addition, the instantaneous queue size is recorded and made available
to OTcl in the \code{size\_} member variable.

The \code{QueueMonitor} class is not derived from \code{Connector}, and
is not linked directly into the network topology.
Rather, objects of the \code{SnoopQueue} class (or its derived classes)
are used instead.
They are defined as follows (in \code{queue-monitor.cc}):
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
        class SnoopQueue : public Connector {
         public:
                SnoopQueue() : qm_(0) {}
                int command(int argc, const char*const* argv) {
                        if (argc == 3) {
                                if (strcmp(argv[1], "set-monitor") == 0) {
                                        qm_ = (QueueMonitor*)
                                                TclObject::lookup(argv[2]);
                                        return (TCL_OK);
                                }
                        }
                        return (Connector::command(argc, argv));
                }
         protected:
                QueueMonitor* qm_;
        };

        class SnoopQueueIn : public SnoopQueue {
         public:
                void recv(Packet* p, Handler* h) {
                        qm_->in(p);
                        send(p, h); /* Connector::send() */
                }
        };

        class SnoopQueueOut : public SnoopQueue {
         public:
                void recv(Packet* p, Handler* h) {
                        qm_->out(p);
                        send(p, h); /* Connector::send() */
                }
        };
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
Objects constructed out of these classes are linked in the simulation
topology as described above and call \code{QueueManager}
\code{out} or \code{in} procedures,
depending on the particular type of snoopy queue.
