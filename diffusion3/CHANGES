Diffusion 3.0.7
---------------

- Added the first alpha version GEAR in the apps directory. Diffusion
  now should be able to use geographic information to route packets,
  not requiring all interest messages to be flooded.
- Changed the filter scheme so now each filter has to have a
  distinct priority (i.e. we don't support two filters with the
  same priority value anymore).
- Merged SendMessage and SendMessageToNext into a single function,
  (SendMessage). It now allows filters to specify the next filter's
  priority and therefore allows filters to be bypassed.
- Changed the message class not to include a copy of the raw packet
  anymore.
- Changed all instances of FLAGGED_DATA to EXPLORATORY_DATA, in order
  to be consistent with the names used elsewhere.
- Added functionality to the API allowing filters work to in a single
  thread mode. Added the doIt() and doOne() API functions to allow
  the application/filter to give up its thread (either permanently
  or just for a moment) for the library API to receive packets and
  manage timers.
- Added the DiffApp class that applications and filters can derive
  from. It adds basic command line parsing code and keeps some of
  the library's interface code.
- Fixed a bug in agent1/agent2 when running in multi-threaded mode
  (there's a lock inside libc that blocks fflush when also doing a
  getc).
- Added the iPaq ARM platform to the supported systems (in config.mk).

Diffusion 3.0.6
---------------

- Added support for BBN's distributed logger.
- Changed the diffPrint function to use the variable argument
  list syntax, as suggested by Peter Boettcher.
- Renamed the agent applications to ping_sender and ping_receiver,
  and added some extra functionality to measure latency and packet
  loss.
- Included the Steel Knight Applications (sk_sensorApp and
  sk_gatewayApp).
- Fixed bug when receiving an incoming message from the MoteNIC.
- Included the nested queries applications in the distribution under
  apps/nested.

Diffusion 3.0.5
---------------

- Changed several makefiles to ease code integration.
- Changed diffusion statistics to include total number of messages sent
  to a neighbor (unicast + broadcast).
- Changed some internal names to allow easier NS integration.
- Added wrappers for time and output functions to allow distributed
  logging and easier NS integration.
- Added option to support delayed positive reinforcement messages in
  response to an exploratory data message.

Diffusion 3.0.4
---------------

- Fixed the code to work when only a single data packet is sent in
  response to an interest message.
- Added more randomization to the code so it works better when clocks
  are synchronized.
- The distribution now includes a source routing filter that can be
  used to send a message along a pre-specified path.
- Tuned diffusion parameters for optimal operation on the SensIT
  hardware.

Diffusion 3.0.3
---------------

- Diffusion can now use alternate ports (instead of the default 2000)
  with the new command line option '-p port'. Other apps will have to
  be change to use this feature.
- The '-s' command line option has been removed.
- This version features an initial implementation of the device independent
  layer in diffusion along with diffusion drivers for the RPC, the MoteNic
  Wired UDP and UDP communication with local modules/apps. Everything has
  been moved to main/drivers.
- Diffusion/and the API library now use dynamically allocated buffers for
  both incoming and outgoing packets.
- Fixed the code to compile without warnings on gcc 2.97 (used to cross
  compile code for the new Sensoria nodes).
- Fixed all Makefiles to include the config.mk configuration file.
- The UDP driver now can support diffusion running on port other than
  2000. The config file for the wired diffusion now accepts the port
  number along with the host ip address. This allows one to run multiple
  'diffusion nodes' on a single machine.
- Diffusion now has a driver for the WINSNG 2.0 nodes' radios.

Diffusion 3.0.2
---------------

- Removed all dependencies from the radiometrix library.
  It should compile fine now with Red Hat 7.1. This version
  of diffusion does not support the old 'userland' implementation
  of the radiometrix drivers.

Diffusion 3.0.1
---------------

Initial release of diffusion 3.
