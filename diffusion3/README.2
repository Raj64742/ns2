1. Compiling Diffusion

Diffusion should compile cleanly by just typing 'make' on
Linux. It has been tested with Red Hat Linux versions 6.1,
6.2, 7.0 and 7.1.

Diffusion uses a random ID for the each node. This behavior can
be overridden by setting the 'scadds_addr' environment variable to
the desired ID. Under bash, this can be done with:

bash# export scadds_addr=2

This package contains several sample applications as well as 'system
modules', located in the apps directory. After compilation, all
applications will be created in the apps directory.

2. Before Running Diffusion

Before starting diffusion, be sure to have rpcd (the radiometrix
module) already running on the node.

Note that in the wired case, the file 'config.txt' should be present
and contain a list of all directly connected nodes, one node in each
line. If connected nodes are running on a port other than the default
diffusion port (done by using the '-p' flag), this must be indicated
in the config file as well. When diffusion initializes, it will
display the list of connected nodes. An alternate configuration file
can be specified with the -f flag. Also, the config file can include
the link quality to each neighbor.  It's an integer from 0 to 100 and
will indicate the probability of a message sent by your node to reach
this neighbor. A sample configuration file is:

10.0.0.1 - 3400 - 100
10.2.4.1 - 30
10.3.12.4 - 85

In this case, we have three neighbors (10.0.0.1, 10.2.4.1 and
10.3.12.4), to which the probability of a packet getting lost is 0,
70% and 15% respectively. Note that the first neighbor (10.0.0.1) is
running on the port 3400 (instead of the default diffusion port, 2000).
Since the link quality is an integer from 0 to 100, and the port number
has to be above 1024, diffusion can correctly guess the second argument's
meaning if there are just 2 arguments in a config line.

3. Running Diffusion

To run diffusion, simply start the 'diffusion' and then the
applications/modules desired.  Please allow a few seconds for
diffusion to initialize before starting applications and modules. Be
sure to at least start the gradient module. For debugging, the logging
module can be used to print all messages arriving at the node.

To test if things are working, start diffusion, gradient and
agent2 in a node. Then start diffusion, gradient and agent1 in
another node. Agent1 should receive agent2's messages after a few
seconds.

Please note that if diffusion is run with the '-p port' flag,
all other applications will also need it (i.e. gradient -p port,
agent1 -p port, etc...).
