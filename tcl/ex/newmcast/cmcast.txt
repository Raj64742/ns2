RP    : node 3

Register msgs in   : blue
native data pkts in: black

time    entity  event
========================
0.2	node 2:	starts sending in CBR -> registers
0.3	node 1: joins (won't see join messages 'cause this is session mcast)
		but see native data pkts from node 3-> node 1
0.4	node 0: joins, data pkts from node 3-> node 1-> node 0

*0.45	switch tree type from RP tree to shortest path tree
	native data pkts from node 2-> node 1-> node 0
	(slow motion here will see better
)
0.6	node 3: joins, data pkt from node 2 -> node 1 -> node 3 and 0
0.7	node 0: leaves, node 1 stop forwarding to node 0

*0.85	recompute mroutes: pretty much everything stays the same

0.9	node 3: leaves, node 1 stop forwarding to node 3
1.0	node 1: leaves, node 2 stop forwarding to node 1
