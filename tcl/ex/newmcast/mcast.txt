'ns mcast1.tcl' demonstrates CtrMcast in ns. In CtrMcast, a
centralized computation agent is used to build the mulitcast
distribution trees.
'ns mcast2.tcl' demonstrates the use of dynamicDM. This is a dense
mode protocol that adapts to network dynamics (based on DVMRP). (Note
that the 'detailedDM' protocol is the recommended dense mode protocol
for use in ns)
'ns mcast3.tcl' demonstrates the use of DM. DM is a basic dense mode
protocol based on DVMRP that does not adapt to network dynamics.
