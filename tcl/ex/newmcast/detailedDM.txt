detailedDM1.tcl and detailedDM2.tcl demonstrate the use of the dense
mode protocol, detailedDM.
detailedDM is a dense mode protocol based on PIM-Dense Mode. It adapts
to network dynamics and works with LAN topologies (where LANs are
created by the multi-link-of-interfaces method). Note that this is the
recommended dense mode protocol for use in ns.
To run these scripts do:
ns detailedDM1.tcl
ns detailedDM2.tcl
