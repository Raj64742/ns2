# This example script demonstrates using the token bucket filter as a
# traffic-shaper. 
# There are 2 identical source models(exponential on/off) connected to a common
# receiver. One of the sources is connected via a tbf whereas the other one is 
# connected directly.The tbf parameters are such that they shape the exponential
# on/off source to look like a cbr-like source.
