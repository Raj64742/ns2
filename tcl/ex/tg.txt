"ns tg.tcl" tests the following traffic generation modules:

1.  on/off source with exponentially distributed on/off times.
2.  same as above, but with pareto distributed on/off times.
3.  traffic generation based on contents of a file (i.e., a trace).

The plot shows packets from four connections.  The bottom connection
is an exponential on/off source, the next connection is a pareto on/off source,
and the third and fourth connections generate traffic based on the trace file
"example-trace".
