There are three example scripts to demonstrate the implementation of
SRM.  These are simple-srm.tcl, srm2.tcl, and srm_star.tcl.  When the
results from each of these scripts is viewed in nam, data traffic is
coloured black, traffic from the source is coloured white, and traffic
from the the receivers is multi-coloured.

Traffic from the source consists of session messages, and repairs.
Traffic from the receivers is session messages, requests, and
(occasionally) repairs.

(NB:  If DM multicasting is used, then expect to send periodic prunes and
joins as explicit messages).

Example 1:  simple-srm.tcl is a Y topology, with the source at the
center, and receivers at each of the arms.  The data source is an
exponential traffic generator (see tg.txt, tg.tcl for additional
details).  The traffic generator directly feeds the srm agent.  (This
is unlike earlier situations where the traffic generator feeds the node
directly).  Data generation starts at 0.5s.  Nodes 1, 2, and 3 join at
1.0s., 1.1s., and 1.2s respectively.  As each node comes up, it
requests the initial sequence of data from the source that it is
currently missing.  Request messages will start appearing after about 3s.
because the nodes have nto computed distances to each other accurately yet.

Example 2: srm2.tcl is chain topology, with a CBR source at node 0.
All the nodes join the group at time t =~ 1.0s.  They take another 3.0s
to determine distances to all other group members.  The traffic
generator starts at 3.5s.  A single packet drop is created through link
dynamics (the link is toggled momentarily using one of the route
models) at 3.52s.

Example 3: srm_star.tcl is a star topology, with identical parameters
to the earlier chain topology.  You can vary the number of nodes in the
topology by editing srm_star.tcl.  However, the nam config file is
written for a 8 (+1) node topology.

In each of the examples, output statistics is written out to
srm-stats.tr.
