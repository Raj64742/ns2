"ns srm-demo.tcl": a Reliable Multicast demo using nam.
From the change log: "a simple, completely contrived script to generate
SRM-like sample paths to illustrate SRM".

At time 1.0 a CBR source at node 14 starts sending (red packets) to
group B, which has nodes 0-8 as members.
Receivers are of type "Agent/Message/MC_Acker", and send an ACK (white
packet) unicast to the source for every packet.

Starting at time 1.5, receivers at nodes 0-8 are of type
"Agent/Message/MC_Nacker", and send unicast NACK packets (blue)
to the origin sender.
Congestion is created by unicast connections (yellow packets),
causing multicast packets to be dropped also.

Starting at time 3.0, receivers at nodes 0-8 are of type
"Agent/Message/MC_SRM" using deterministic behavior, and at a
deterministic time send NACK/request packets multicast to the group.

Starting at time 3.5, receivers at nodes 0-8 are now of type
"Agent/Message/MC_SRM" using randomization.  Using randomization to
determine when to sent a request, a receiver sends the
request multicast to the group.
