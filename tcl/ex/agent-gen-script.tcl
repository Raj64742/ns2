# This file is an example script for using the topology generator,
# the routing generator and the agents generator together as part
# of the scenario generator
# Created by Ahmed Helmy, June 98.

# source the generators code (this is not part of the release yet)
source topo-gen.tcl
source agent-gen.tcl
source route-gen.tcl

# setup the files that will contain the scripts generated
set topofile topo1.tcl
set agentfile agent1.tcl
set routefile route1.tcl

# we remove the agentfile, to start afresh... the agentfile is
# opened in append mode and previous runs may cause problems
if { [file exists $agentfile] } {
	catch { [exec rm $agentfile] }
}

# generate the topology creation script
puts {topology -outfile $topofile -nodes 50 -connection_prob 0.1}
topology -outfile $topofile -nodes 15 -connection_prob 0.1

# set the route settings for unicast/mcast
puts {routing -outfile $routefile -unicast Session -multicast CtrMcast}
routing -outfile $routefile -unicast Session -multicast CtrMcast

# generate the agent creation script
puts {agents -outfile $agentfile -transport TCP/Reno -src FTP \
	-sink TCPSink/DelAck -num 60% -start 1-3 -stop 9-11}

# the marker merely serves as debugging aid to make sure that
# all the code was written to file, and was not disrupted due
# to failure or disk full... etc, it also contains all the 
# the command lines used to generate the code.

# now that we've generated the tcl scripts, source them and call
# the procs to start the simulations.
