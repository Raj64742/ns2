# A lot of agents want to store the maxttl locally.  However,
# setting a class variable based on the Agent::ttl_ variable
# does not help if the user redefines Agent::ttl_.  Therefore,
# Agents interested in the maxttl_ should call this function
# with the name of their class variable, and it is set to the
# maximum of the current/previous value.
#
# The function itself returns the value of ttl_ set.
#
# I use this function from agent constructors to set appropriate vars:
# for instance to set Agent/rtProto/DV::INFINITY, or
# Agent/SRM/SSM::ttlGroupScope_
