# module, which then dispatches it to route-new, etc., depending on the 
# MPLS classifier status of the slot. This should not be done as a callback

# XXX This is a really bad way to check if routing table is built.
# During initialization of dynamic routing (e.g., DV), at each node, for 
# each possible destination, a nullAgent_ will be added to the routing table.
#
# Since rtable-ready does not know this, it will think that routing table
# is ready and start to compute routes. This is the reason that routing-new{}
# must do a special check (route-nochange{} does not need it because it is 
# only called when an existing slot is replaced, which cannot happen during 
# the initialization phase).
#
# A better way should be let Node to intercept add-route{}, and updated 
# rtable_ only when the target is not the default null agent. However, this 
# is difficult with current node-config design, where node types are exclusive.
# But this will change as time goes by.
