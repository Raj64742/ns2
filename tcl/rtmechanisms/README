This directory contains files used to build the tests for the
following in-progress paper:
	Floyd, S., and Fall, K.,
	Router Mechanisms to Support End-to-End Congestion Control.
	ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/collapse.ps

rtm.tcl			contains the simulation tests
mechanisms.tcl		main support routines for implementing the mechanisms
rtm_link.tcl		code to build links with router mechanisms
