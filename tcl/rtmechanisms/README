This directory contains files used to build the tests for the
following in-progress paper:
	Floyd, S., and Fall, K.,
	Router Mechanisms to Support End-to-End Congestion Control.
	ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/collapse.ps


----------------------------------------------------------------

rtm_reclass.tcl		Main test file for the router mechanisms simulations
mechanisms.tcl		main support routines for implementing the mechanisms
sources.tcl		Creates TCP and CBR connections.
rtm_plot.tcl		Routines to perform post processing.

rtm.tcl ?		contains the simulation tests
rtm_link.tcl		Code to build links with router mechanisms
rtm_tests.tcl		Tests for detecting unfriendly, unresponsive 
				and high-bw flows

USING RED DROP HISTORY:
bdflow.tcl		To run tests.
bdflow_h.tcl		Routines to perform post processing for bdflow.tcl
bound.tcl		Chernoff bounds for bdflow_h.tcl

FAIRNESS AND CONGESTION COLLAPSE TESTS:
Collapseall.tcl		To run the "congestion collapse" simulations
Fairnessall.tcl		To run the "fairness" simulations
Collapse.tcl		Contains simulation tests for congestion collapse 
				and fairness simulations
Fairnessall1.tcl	Processes output for congestion collapse 
				and fairness simulations

GENERAL UTILITIES:
Setred.tcl		Changes default RED parameters.
flowmon.tcl		Makes a flow monitor, attaches it to link.


NOT USED:
flow4.tcl?		Not used.
Flows.tcl?		Not used.  (Called by flow4.tcl.)
traffic.tcl?		Not called.





At present, this code is experimental and "in-progress".
