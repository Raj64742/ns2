This directory contains files used to build the tests for the
following in-progress paper:
	Floyd, S., and Fall, K.,
	Router Mechanisms to Support End-to-End Congestion Control.

----------------------------------------------------------------
# ../../ns rtm_reclass.tcl three net3

rtm_reclass.tcl		Main test file for the router mechanisms simulations
			  Called by rtm_link.tcl.
sources.tcl		Creates TCP and CBR connections.
rtm_plot.tcl		Routines to perform post processing.

rtm.tcl 		contains simulation tests
rtm_link.tcl		Code to build links with router mechanisms

rtm_tests.tcl		Tests for detecting unfriendly, unresponsive 
			  and high-bw flows.  Used by mechanisms.tcl.
mechanisms.tcl		main support routines for implementing the mechanisms
			  Called by rtm_reclass.tcl, rtm.tcl.

USING RED DROP HISTORY:
bdflow.tcl		To run tests.
bdflow_h.tcl		Routines to perform post processing for bdflow.tcl
bound.tcl		Chernoff bounds for bdflow_h.tcl

FAIRNESS AND CONGESTION COLLAPSE TESTS:
Collapseall.tcl		To run the "congestion collapse" simulations
Fairnessall.tcl		To run the "fairness" simulations
Collapse.tcl		Contains simulation tests for congestion collapse 
				and fairness simulations
Fairnessall1.tcl	Processes output for congestion collapse 
				and fairness simulations

GENERAL UTILITIES:
Setred.tcl		Changes default RED parameters.


USING RED DROP HISTORY:
flow4.tcl	
Flows.tcl		(Called by flow4.tcl.)

NOT USED:
traffic.tcl?		Not called.





At present, this code is experimental and "in-progress".

------------------------------------------------------------

../../ns rtm_reclass.tcl two net3
#  To illustrate the "unfriendly" test.

# This is similar to the test in the paper.
../../ns rtm_reclass.tcl three net3
#  To test the "unresponsive" test.
../../ns rtm_reclass.tcl three net3 disable

../../ns Collapseall.tcl
#  To run the "congestion collapse" simulations.

../../ns Fairnessall.tcl
#  To run the "fairness" simulations.

../../ns bdflow.tcl combined 12345
../../ns Flow4.v2.tcl combined 12345 
#  To run tests of RED drop history

Turn off HIGH test:
rtm_tests.tcl: set High_const_ 120000
