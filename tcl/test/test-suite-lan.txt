The LAN test suite (test-suite-lan.tcl) performs the following tests:
    - lan-routing-flat
    - lan-routing-hier - these two tests are designed to validate LANs
      under flat and hierarchical routing and specifically the
      functionality of the lanRouter object.  The topology is the same
      in both cases: 

	       0	  2----------5
	       |	  |
	    ---+----+-----+-- LAN virtual node (3)
	            |
      4-------------1
      
      
      with a TCP sender attached to node 4 and a TCP receiver at node
      5.  Here packets are not replicated at the LAN, because they are
      unicast and replication is costly.  Packets flow from node 4 to
      1, then the lanRouter object determines the next hop of the
      packet (node 2) and packets with unicast MAC address of node 2
      are put on the shared medium (channel).  Since the packet has a
      unicast MAC address of 2, MAC classifier delivers it to 2 only,
      at which point it is forwarded to 5.  TCP acknowledgements are
      delivered in a similar fashion in reverse direction.

      WARNING: the current nam animation (as of 11/23/98) shows that
      all packets (including unicast) are replicated and delivered to
      every node on the LAN.  This is misleading, because in the
      unicast case packets are delivered only to the next hop node.

    - lan-broadcast: tests the broadcast behavior of mac classifier.

      (vLAN node 3)   --+-------+  5

				 1

      A CBR agent at node 4 is sending unicast packets to a receiver
      at node 5.  But in this case the MAC classifier is explicitly
      running in the broadcast mode and even though the IP
      consequently the MAC address is unicast, packets are fanned out
      and delivered both to 2 and to 1.  Both 2 and 1 receive the
      packet, classify it as addressed to 5 and forward accordingly.
      Thus the receiver at 5 receives two copies of the same packet.
