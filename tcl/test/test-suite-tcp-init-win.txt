The tests of options for TCP's initial window can be tested
with the command "./test-all-tcp-init-win" in the directory
tcl/test.

These tests verify the following two options added to the
implementations of one-way TCP:

Agent/TCP, syn_:

For the default, with "syn_" set to false, TCP does not model the
initial SYN/ACK exchange.  With "syn_" set to true, TCP
does model the initial SYN/ACK exchange, in the following sense:
a single packet is sent, and ack is received, and then the initial
window is sent to its specified value.

Agent/TCP, windowInitOption_:

For the default, with "windowInitOption_" set to 1, the TCP initial
window is set to the number of packets specified in "windowInit_",
which itself is set by default to one packet.  For "windowInitOption_"
set to 2, the TCP initial window is set to the number of packets
specified in internet draft draft-floyd-incr-init-win-01.txt on
"Increasing TCP's Initial Window".  That is, for a packet size of
at most 1095 bytes, the initial window is set to four packets.
For a packet size between 1095 and 2190 bytes, the initial window
is set to three packets, and for a packet size of 2190 bytes or
more, the initial window is set to two packets.

The first tests, init1 to init4, test the initial window options
with Tahoe TCP.
