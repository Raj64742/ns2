The tests of options for TCP's initial window can be tested
with the command "./test-all-tcp-init-win" in the directory
tcl/test.

These tests verify the following options added to the
implementations of one-way TCP.  The proposal in the
internet draft "Increasing TCP's Initial Window" can be
modeled by setting syn_ and delay_growth_ to true, and
setting windowInitOption_ to 2.

Agent/TCP, syn_:

For the default, with "syn_" set to false, TCP does not model the
initial SYN/ACK exchange.  With "syn_" set to true, TCP does model
the initial SYN/ACK exchange, in that for "syn_" set to true, the
initial packet is of size tcpip_base_hdr_size_ (40 bytes).

Agent/TCP, delay_growth_:

For the default, with delay_growth_ set to false, the initial window
applies to the first packet.  With delay_growth_ set to true,
the initial congestion window only applies after a single packet
has been sent and acknowledged.

Agent/TCP, windowInitOption_:

For the default, with "windowInitOption_" set to 1, the TCP initial
window is set to the number of packets specified in "windowInit_",
which itself is set by default to one packet.  For "windowInitOption_"
set to 2, the TCP initial window is set to the number of packets
specified in internet draft draft-floyd-incr-init-win-01.txt on
"Increasing TCP's Initial Window".  That is, for a packet size of
at most 1095 bytes, the initial window is set to four packets.
For a packet size between 1095 and 2190 bytes, the initial window
is set to three packets, and for a packet size of 2190 bytes or
more, the initial window is set to two packets.

--------------------------------------

The first tests, init1 to init4, test the initial window options
with Tahoe TCP.  

The top connections in the tests "init1", "init2", and init3" all use
"syn_" set to true and "windowInitOption_" set to 2, for the initial
window specified in the internet draft.  All connections with "syn_" set
to true also have "delay_growth_" set to true.  The packet sizes in these
three tests are 1000 bytes, 1500 bytes, and 4000 bytes, for initial
windows of two, three, and four packets respectively.

The bottom connections in the tests "init1", "init2", and init3" all
use "windowInitOption_" set to 1, for the initial window specified in
"windowInit_".  "Init1" and "init2" use the default initial window of
one packet;  "init3" uses an initial window of six packets.  For
"init1", "syn_" is set to true, to model the transmission of a SYN
packet before the initial window.  For the bottom connections in
"init2" and init3", "syn_" is set to false.

"Init4" shows two connections with 1000-byte packets using the initial
window specified in the internet draft.  The test shows that after a
Fast Retransmit, TCP slow-starts from an initial window of one packet.

The tests "init5" through "init8" repeat these tests for Reno TCP.
"Init8" shows that after a Retransmit Timeout, TCP slow-starts from an
initial window of one packet.

The tests "init9" through "init12" repeat these tests for NewReno TCP.
and tests "init13" through "init16" repeat these tests for Sack TCP.
