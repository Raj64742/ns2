The tests of options for TCP's initial window can be tested
with the command "./test-all-tcp-init-win" in the directory
tcl/test.

These tests verify the following two options added to the
implementations of one-way TCP:

Agent/TCP, syn_:

For the default, with "syn_" set to false, TCP does not model the
initial SYN/ACK exchange.  With "syn_" set to true, TCP
does model the initial SYN/ACK exchange, in the following sense:
a single packet of size synSize_ (40 bytes) is sent, an ack is received, 
and then the initial window is sent to its specified value.
Currently, the model in the simulator does not include the sender
sending a separate ACK packet to acknowledge the SYN/ACK from the
receiver.

Agent/TCP, windowInitOption_:

For the default, with "windowInitOption_" set to 1, the TCP initial
window is set to the number of packets specified in "windowInit_",
which itself is set by default to one packet.  For "windowInitOption_"
set to 2, the TCP initial window is set to the number of packets
specified in internet draft draft-floyd-incr-init-win-01.txt on
"Increasing TCP's Initial Window".  That is, for a packet size of
at most 1095 bytes, the initial window is set to four packets.
For a packet size between 1095 and 2190 bytes, the initial window
is set to three packets, and for a packet size of 2190 bytes or
more, the initial window is set to two packets.

--------------------------------------

The first tests, init1 to init4, test the initial window options
with Tahoe TCP.  

The top connections in the tests "init1", "init2", and init3" all use
"syn_" set to true and "windowInitOption_" set to 2, for the initial
window specified in the internet draft.  The packet sizes in these
three tests are 1000 bytes, 1500 bytes, and 4000 bytes, for initial
windows of two, three, and four packets respectively.

The bottom connections in the tests "init1", "init2", and init3" all
use "windowInitOption_" set to 1, for the initial window specified in
"windowInit_".  "Init1" and "init2" use the default initial window of
one packet;  "init3" uses an initial window of six packets.  For
"init1", "syn_" is set to true, to model the transmission of a SYN
packet before the initial window.  For the bottom connections in
"init2" and init3", "syn_" is set to false.

"Init4" shows two connections with 1000-byte packets using the initial
window specified in the internet draft.  The test shows that after a
Fast Retransmit, TCP slow-starts from an initial window of one packet.

The tests "init5" through "init8" repeat these tests for Reno TCP.
"Init8" shows that after a Retransmit Timeout, TCP slow-starts from an
initial window of one packet.

The tests "init9" through "init12" repeat these tests for NewReno TCP.
and tests "init13" through "init16" repeat these tests for Sack TCP.
