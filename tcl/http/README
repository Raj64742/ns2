http-single.tcl and http-mult.tcl were contributed to VINT
by Curtis Villamizar.

Sample commands to run them:

ns http-single.tcl -window 8 -maxflow 4 -maxinline 4

ns http-mult.tcl -seed 1 -persist -tail -window 8 -netqueue 40 -maxflow 4 -maxinline 4 -bkgproxy -bkg-flows 10 -clickers 2

Http-mult currently goes into an infinite loop if -clickers is
greater than 2.  This is clearly a bug.

These programs require patches to ns-2.0a17 commited 23-May-97.
